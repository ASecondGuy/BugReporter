# BugReporter
The BugReporter allows players to send messages using a discord webhook.  
This allows easy and low maintanance feedback from directly inside your game.  
Webhooks can be easily abused for anonymous automated spam. That makes this a bad solution for games with many players.  
Tested for Godot 4.0.3 4.1.3 4.2.2 4.3 4.4.1 and 4.5 (All versions I still had installed).
